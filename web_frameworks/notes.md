# Web Frameworks.

## Info:

A browser website works by receiving 3 files from a server using http/https. These files are:
1. A html file that contains all the text/content of the website.
2. A CSS file that contains all the format/style of the website.
3. A JavaScript all the functions/actions of the website.

The browser then uses those 3 files to display the website.

## Flask

A micro webframework tool which allows us to build light web servers with Python. 
When using flask if you want to render an html as an app route you need to add the html and other files in 
a templates folder.
